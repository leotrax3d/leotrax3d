## Who I Am

3D printing enthusiast learning to program. I'm a maker who wants to bring software skills into my toolkit.

## Current Status

**Learning Programming**

I'm at the very beginning of learning to code. Right now I'm working through Java fundamentals and trying to understand basic programming concepts. This GitHub profile will document my learning journey.

**What I Know**

3D printing is where I have real experience. I work with FDM printers, design models, and solve practical printing challenges. Programming is completely new territory for me.

## Active Learning

- Working through Java basics
- Learning Git and version control
- Practicing with small exercises
- Making mistakes and learning from them

## Projects

My repositories are learning exercises. Don't expect polished code - expect a beginner figuring things out. I'm using GitHub to track my progress and get comfortable with development workflows.

## Interests

**3D Printing**

This is my main skill. I can design, troubleshoot, and optimize prints. I understand the hardware and software side of 3D printing.

**Game Development**

I follow SevnGames and am interested in how games are made. Once I understand programming better, I'd like to contribute.

**Making Things**

I like building physical projects. Learning to code means I can add interactivity and intelligence to what I build.

## Looking For

- Beginner-friendly resources
- Patient people who remember what it's like to start
- Simple projects to practice on
- Honest feedback on my code

## Goals

- Understand Java well enough to build something useful
- Contribute to a real project
- Create tools for my 3D printing workflow
- Keep learning consistently

## Connect

- GitHub: github.com/leotrax3d
- Email: [your email]

## Reality Check

I'm genuinely new to programming. If you look at my code and see beginner mistakes, that's because I'm a beginner. I'm here to learn and improve over time.

Learning to code takes time. I'm committed to the process.
