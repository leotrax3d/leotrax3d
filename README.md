## Who I Am

3D printing enthusiast learning to program. I'm a maker who wants to bring software skills into my toolkit.

## Current Status

**Learning Programming**

I'm at the very beginning of learning to code. Right now I'm working through Java fundamentals and trying to understand basic programming concepts and Full-Stack Development.

**What I Know**

3D printing is where I have real experience. I work with FDM printers, design models, and solve practical printing challenges.

## Active Learning

- Making mistakes and learning from them

## Projects

My repositories are learning exercises. Don't expect polished code - expect a beginner figuring things out. I'm using GitHub to track my progress and get comfortable with development workflows.

## Interests

**3D Printing**

This is my main skill. I can design, troubleshoot, and optimize prints. I understand the hardware and software side of 3D printing.

**Making Things**

I like building physical projects. Learning to code means I can add interactivity and intelligence to what I build.

## Looking For

- Beginner-friendly resources
- Patient people who remember what it's like to start
- Simple projects to practice on
- Honest feedback on my code

## Connect

- GitHub: github.com/leotrax3d
